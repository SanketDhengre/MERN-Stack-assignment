Here's the development approach section to add to your README.md:

## üõ†Ô∏è **Development Approach**

### Backend Development:
1. **Structured Setup** - Organized Express app with middleware, routes, and data layers
2. **Security First** - Implemented JWT authentication before adding features
3. **API Design** - RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes and error handling
4. **Performance** - Added pagination, filtering, and rate limiting for scalability
5. **Error Management** - Centralized error handling with meaningful responses

### Frontend Development:
1. **Component Structure** - Single App component managing authentication and data flow
2. **State Management** - React hooks for token, user data, and product state
3. **API Integration** - Fetch API with proper headers and error handling
4. **UX Focus** - Added loading states, pagination controls, and filtering options
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Started basic, then added pagination and filtering features

### Development Methodology:
- **Incremental Build** - Core auth ‚Üí Products API ‚Üí Frontend integration ‚Üí Enhanced features
- **Test-Driven** - Manual API testing with curl before frontend integration
- **Error-First** - Implemented error handling early in development cycle
- **User-Centric** - Focused on practical user workflows (login ‚Üí view products ‚Üí filter/paginate)

This approach ensured a robust, scalable application with clean separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.
